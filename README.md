# Geode Android Launcher

Launches a vanilla copy of Geometry Dash with the Geode loader added.

## TODO:

* Implement remaining Java methods (text editing)
* Figure out better way of packaging libgeode
* Back button support
  * (seems to be a focus issue? pressing a key on keyboard allows for the back button to be used)
* Fix icon in launcher
